# LoginAssignment
Project Description -

The Project contains all the required operations and details.
First page contains Login activity. If you have an account then login with it. otherwise the second activity contains a signup page to make an account then sign in with it. These two activities have used Firebase.
After sign in,  then it redirects to a third activity which shows data (used Realm database for storage) in recyclerView. With the help of a spinner we can sort recycler view data on the bases of Name, Age and City.

Note: you can sign in with (user name = sonam@gmail.com, password = Sonam*1234) if you don't want to signup. 
with firebase use for signin and signup you have to give a proper email like the above one otherwise it'll give you an exception.

This project is based on all new updates.
